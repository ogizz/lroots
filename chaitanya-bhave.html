                                            Linking Roots got in touch with a budding musician Chaitanya Bhave from Indian Institue of Technology(IIT), Delhi. Young lad Bhave is currently the director of IIT Delhi’s Indian Music Society, Mridang. On being asked about himself, this IIT Delhi student promptly declared himself as someone passionate about music. Chaitanya particularly enjoys Indian classical music and progressive rock. Apart from being the “sane” one who knocks sense into his friends if they fool around too much, Bhave is a football enthusiast and a proud Chelsea supporter.

                                        Besides getting into IIT Delhi, one of the most prestigious institutes of India, Bhave has always been an achiever. As a school kid, Chaitanya won a number of group singing competitions on school as well as district level. His desire for pursuing music however intensified as he joined IIT Delhi. Being around so many immensely talented individuals in college gave him motivation, he says. This motivation got him to pick up the guitar and get going. He decided to pursue music and that he did.

                                            </li>
    								<p>
                                        In his first year of college, Chaitanya won the inter-hostel competition as a prt of the Zanskaar hostel’s music team. This, he says, was one of his initial achievements in his journey of music, and worked as a driving force for him to work harder and harder in the field and there has been no looking back ever since. Being considered responsible and sensible enough to be able to carry on the legacy of Mridang as a Director, Chaitanya says, was another remarkable achievement in his journey.

As it is true for most of the co-curricular activities that many pursue in college, /someone like Chaitanya who wishes to pursue music, there are often a number of stereotypes associated. From being left out of a dinner/party plan to family members who don’t seem to understand the concept of taking up something like music as a career, Chaitanya faces it all and thrives to only become strnger and keep going.

                                       “Music is like ocean of endless possibilities and opportunities. There is so much one can explore.” Bhave believes that learning never stops and music is eternal and has no limit t it, no boundaries. There are vast oceans of opportunities to be explored, only one needs to be willing to work hard.

Everyone’s lives have its ups and downs and so did Chaitanya’s. The pressure of being in IIT Delhi and performing well in academics while his heart lay in music, Chaitanya , at one point, lost his track and hence his academics suffered heavily. But he did not let this break him down, he fought though and got his act back together. This he feels was one of the lowest points in his journey of music. Talking of the “ups”, Bhave recalled the time when he and his team won the Iner-Hostel band competition and the happiness that came with the victory.

“There is a lot more o life than just academics” , says the young IITian. Growing up listening to his mother’s playlist, Music came to him naturally, he feels. “My mother used to listen to Indian Classical music and I would try to imitate the classical singers and that is how I started getting inclined towards it.” In a country where the music preferences of a majority of people are directed by Bollywood, it becomes difficult for artistes of Indie-Pop or other unconventional genres to make it big. This, he feels, is one of the biggest struggles on faces in India as a musician. Musicians belonging to a particular ‘Gharaana’ being too rigid to try something else or not appreciating someone from a different ‘gharaana’ too, Bhave feels, is something that needs to change in the music scenario of  our country.

“If you are determined and confident enough to choose music as a career and are sure about it, you must never back down. There are plenty of opportunities out there. They come and go, you just have to grab them and face all the challenges it throws at you.” Bhave as a musician believes in staying strong and fighting through every obstacle with a brave face. Practice, practice, and more practice is the biggest secret to being a successful musician according to Chaitanya Bhave. “The more ‘Riyaaz’ you do, the better you keep getting”.
